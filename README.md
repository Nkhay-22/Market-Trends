### Project Overview
 In this sales analysis report, I collated data on the performance of Adidas, a leading global sportswear brand, over the past years (2020-2021). Leveraging data analysis tools such as Microsoft Excel, I provided valuable insights into Adidas’ sales performance, market trends, and growth opportunities. This report highlights key metrics, analyses product performance, examines regional sales trends, and offers strategic recommendations to optimize sales and maintain a competitive edge in the sportswear industry.
### Data Source
 The dataset used for this project was obtained from Kaggle named “Adidas Sales Dataset” and was converted from an XLSX file to a CSV file for easier handling. This dataset consists of 9652 rows and 14 Columns in total.
 It includes details such as the retailer, number of units sold, total sales revenue, location of sales, type of product sold, and other relevant information. 
 Currency denomination is USD.
### Analysis Tools Used
  - Microsoft Excel (Data cleaning and visualization)[Download here](https://microsoft.com)
  - Microsoft Powerpoint (Report and insights)

### Data cleaning and preparation
The following tasks were carried out in the data preparation stage:
-  Importing the raw data into my analysis software(Microsoft Excel)
-  Examining the data to identify missing values, outliers, and other issues.
-  Removing or modifying any errors or inconsistencies in the data.
-  Performing necessary transformations to the data to make it more suitable for analysis, such as aggregating or normalizing data.

### Exploratory Data Analysis
After the data was properly cleaned and prepared, exploratory data analysis (EDA) was conducted to gain insights into the characteristics of the dataset and to identify potential relationships between variables, such as:
- The best selling product
- The sales method that generated the highest revenue
- Which retailer made the highest and least purchase?
- Which months or years had the highest and lowest sales figures?
- Which products are generating the highest sales revenue?
- Which region recorded the highest sales?
